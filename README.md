# Running the Project

- First of all you will need to run `npm install` at the top level directory
- Next run the command `npm run setup` this will initialise the msql database
  - Note this script will install msql to your terminal
- To generate the output file `npm start`.
- After you are finished feel free to teardown the database by running `npm run teardown`.

## Troubleshooting

If for some reason it doesn't generate, I have included the output that was generated on my computer in the folder `/files/sampleOutput/output.csv`
